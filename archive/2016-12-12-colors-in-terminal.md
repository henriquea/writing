# Colors in Terminal

**Update 13/12/16** &mdash; I've added more context. Also more information on text styles and resource links at the bottom.

I built a little CLI tool [that-color](https://github.com/henriquea/that-color/) to name a color from a given hex. It also gives a nice color scale from [hello-color](https://github.com/jxnblk/hello-color). I use this tool often when I'm writing styleguide or mocking up components. I don't have to think about color names, values or open the browser.

I started this project using the modules `colors`, `terminal-kit` and `ansy-styles`. The first time I used `ansi-styles` I got undefined trying to ouput the `style.color`. I looked into the code and from there I started a quick research around this subject.

Before write this library I didn't bother to understand how colors works in terminal. Just because this ðŸ‘‡ didn't look _friendly_.

```
printf "\u001b[38;2;230;90;180mhello world\u001b[0m"
```

It turned out to be more simple than I thought.

- `\u001B` unicode [ANSI escape code](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). By the way `\u001B`, `\x1b` and `\e` are different ways to write the same thing.
- `[` part of ANSI sequence escape.
- `38;`is the xterm-256 foreground color code. Use `48` to change the background color instead.
- `2;` is the color format code for 24-bit RGB [Truecolor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth#True_color_.2824-bit.29) ANSI support.
- `m` end of the sequence.
- `\u001b[0m` reset all changes for the next escape sequence.

Translating it to JavaScript make it easier to read and parse in my head:

```
`\u001B[${fg|bg};2;${r};${g};${b}m${msg}`
```

## Text style

The first parameter after `[` determines the style of the text. This value is off by default. Some of the attributes are: `0` for off, `1` for bold, `2` for underscore and `3` for blink.

Now the code looks like:

```
`\u001B[${style};${fg|bg};2;${r};${g};${b}m${msg}`
```

Not bad right!? You can use [supports-color](https://github.com/chalk/supports-color) to detect terminal color support. Now you're all set to build your own `colors.js` module or just use [ansy-styles](https://github.com/chalk/ansi-styles).

## Self note

Doing a bit of homework and trying to understand how things works under the hood is always self-rewarding.
